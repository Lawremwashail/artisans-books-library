## Implementation Details
- Built using **Ruby on Rails 8**, utilizing its default authentication system.
- Users can **browse books**, **borrow available books**, and **return borrowed books**.
- Each borrowing creates a **Borrowing record** associating the **User** and **Book**, with a **due date** (set to **2 weeks from borrowing date**).
- Implemented **model validations** for book attributes and borrowing constraints.
- Includes **automated tests** for models, controllers, and views using **RSpec**.
